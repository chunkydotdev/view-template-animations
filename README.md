A showcase of modern scroll-based animations using the CSS `view-timeline` property, without any JavaScript!

## üåü Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create engaging scroll animations using pure CSS with the modern `view-timeline` property. Each section showcases a different animation technique that triggers as you scroll:

1. **Hero Section** - Fade effects
2. **Split Section** - Panels sliding from both sides
3. **Card Stack** - Cards spreading out in a fan effect
4. **Text Motion** - Text flowing across the screen from alternate sides
5. **Final Section** - Gradient transition with fade effects

## üìö What is View Timeline?

The CSS View Timeline feature allows you to create scroll-linked animations without JavaScript. It's part of the [CSS Scroll-driven Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll-driven_animations) specification.

### Key Components:

- **`view-timeline-name`**: Names a timeline based on an element's position in the viewport
- **`view-timeline-axis`**: Defines the axis (block/inline) for measuring the element's progress
- **`animation-timeline`**: Binds an animation to a view timeline
- **`animation-range`**: Defines when the animation starts and ends in relation to the view timeline

## üéØ How It Works

Each section creates its own timeline:

```css
.section {
  view-timeline-name: --section-timeline;
  view-timeline-axis: block;
}
```

Elements are animated as the section moves through the viewport:

```css
.animate-title {
  animation: fade-up 1s linear forwards;
  animation-timeline: --section-timeline;
  animation-range: cover 50% cover 90%;
}
```

## üöÄ Animation Examples

### Sliding Panels

```css
.split-half.left {
  animation: slide-right 1s linear forwards;
  animation-timeline: --section-timeline;
  animation-range: entry 20% cover 40%;
}
```

### Card Fan Effect

```css
.card {
  animation: fan-out 1s linear forwards;
  animation-timeline: --section-timeline;
  animation-range: entry 20% cover 60%;
}
```

### Moving Text

```css
.text-line:nth-child(odd) {
  animation-name: move-left-to-right;
  animation-timeline: --section-timeline;
  animation-range: entry 0% exit 100%;
}
```

## üì± Browser Support

The `view-timeline` property is relatively new and is supported in:
- Chrome 115+
- Edge 115+
- Safari 16.4+
- Firefox 116+

For older browsers, you would need to use JavaScript alternatives like Intersection Observer.
